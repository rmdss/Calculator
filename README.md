# Calculator
This is a simple repository that explains building a calculator using kivy module.

This project follows the tutorial https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2020/12/05/calculator-gui-with-python/ basically and have made some changes.

'Kivy'is an open source library that can be used for implementing user interfaces. Kivy provides different widgets and tools for creating rich, interactive user interfaces, and it supports multi-touch gestures out of the box.

√Ås we are using the 'kivy' module for the calculator , we should import its' 'App' module. 

```from kivy.app import App ```

Then let's create a class called MyApp. In this class, we have used 'App' in brackets. That indicates, this MyApp() class inherits from the App class in Kivy module.

```class MyApp(App):```

Next we will create a function called 'build'.
